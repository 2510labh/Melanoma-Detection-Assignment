# Project Name
> Build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis..

* Load using keras.preprocessing
* Visualize the data
* Create the model
* Visualizing training results

## Conclusions
- Accuracy on training data has increased by using Augmentor library
- Model is still overfitting
- The problem of overfitting can be solved by add more layer,neurons or adding dropout layers.
- The Model can be further improved by tuning the hyperparameter
